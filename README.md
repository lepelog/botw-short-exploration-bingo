# Short Exploration bingo

This includes a modification of the normal bingo which allows for an "Exploration mode", which is that you start with all goals but 2 hidden and once a goal is marked, the 4 surrounding goals are shown.

This is also a modification of the short bingolist (normal here is actually short) so no goals are doubled
